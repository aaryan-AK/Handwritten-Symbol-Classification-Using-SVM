Handwritten Symbol Classification Using SVM

To test our handwritten symbols classifier, you will need to first specify which 
npy files you want to use as inputs to the model. It requires an array of images,
and an array of labels for those images, both as .npy files.

You should edit the test.py script, and at the top you will find a spot to type 
in the path to those two npy files. It will look like this:

#################################################
# Please enter the path to the Images and Labels
# you will be using for testing
test_img_array = './Images2.npy'
test_labels = './Labels2.npy'
#################################################

After you save those changes, you should make sure our trained model is there
in the same folder as the test.py script. It is called trained_svc.pbz2, and 
we generated this file by using our train_svc.py script.

Now you should go to that folder in your terminal and run the command

python test.py

to test our model. It will print out an accuracy score to the terminal.
It will also output the labels it generated as a file: predicted_labels.npy
